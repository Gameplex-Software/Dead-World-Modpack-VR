<p>Dead World is an apocalypse based survival pack where the player's goal is to launch into space using the Advanced Rocketry mod. To do this players must survive the hordes of zombies that show up during the day, and break down the dead, decaying trees for wood. Players will also face the challenge of staying warm. At night the Earth's temperature drops to well below freezing, and the player will be hard pressed to find a source of consistent heat to live through their first few nights. The player is spawned in a bunker (which occasionally spawns in the sky due to a bug, if this happens, please generate a new world). After escaping to bunker the player meets a horde of zombies, which now do not burn in the daylight. The player must escape the monsters long enough to gather wood and return to the bunker to craft tools quickly. The player must then use heat sources (such as the fires outside) to stay warm.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>they were just children when it started... at first they didn't know what was happening, they were told it was all a game. They would practice fighting each other with sticks and hide in their homes when an alarm sounded. Their parents would keep them hidden in the basements, doors locked many days at a time. When the bombs fell, they had to know: there was a war coming, and it would change the world as they knew it forever. The bombings got worse, and minor injuries turned more severe, people started building bunkers in their own homes and storing canned and jarred food. public refuges were constructed in the poorer areas usually causing more injury due to their poor construction. When the final attack came though, few were sheltered, and fewer still survived the wait in cold, damp, musty darkness. A lone survivor awakens, but something in the air is immediately noticeably wrong, different somehow smelling of a heavy sadness of the hostile fight to survive that is to come and the bloody cost this cruel new world places on friendship.</p>
